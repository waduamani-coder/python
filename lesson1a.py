# What is a variable: Variables they are labels which act as containers to hold values. In python, a variable is always associated with some values.
# We use the assignment operator (=) to assign values to a variable.
# Anything that is inside of the quotes is a string
message="Hello there! Hope everything is fine?"
# message2='my auntie said:
print(message)


message2="Good Bye!"
print(message2)


# Concatenating variable (Joining two or more outputs together)
message3=message+message2
print(message3)


# Variables can be named using a letter, a number and an underscore. They can start with a letter and an underscore but not with a number
name_1= "brenda"
print(name_1)

# Variable names cannot contain spaces. We can use the underscore to separate the names.
total_marks= 85
print(total_marks)

# Variable names are not supposed to be keywords/ reserved characters in python
# for="nairobi"
# print(for)
