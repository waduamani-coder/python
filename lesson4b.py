# Loops-> sometimes we may need to do a piece of work a number of repeated times in such cases we may use loops.
# A loop is a control structure that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
# There are two types of loops in python i.e:The for loop and the while loop
# Below is the syntax of a loop in python:
"""
for variable in range(n):
    # block of code to be executed
"""
for greeting in range(5):
    print("Hello Moses", greeting)


print("=====================")    

for number in range(10 , 20):
    print(number)


print("=====================")
# find the even numbers in the range of 50 to 71
for number in range(50 ,71, 2):
    print(number)
print("=====================")
# create a python program that prints the odd numbers from 100 to 150
for number in range(101, 150, 2):
    print(number)
print("=====================")    
# create a program that prints the multiples of 3 starting from 201 to 150
for number in range(201,150,-3):
    print(number)
print("=====================")
# craetye a python program that prints the leap years in between 2000 and 2024
for number in range(2000,2024, 400):
    print(number)
