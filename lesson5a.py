# Python functions
# They are a block of code/statement that performs a given task/action.They can be reused throughout the program to perform different tasks.
# Functions are defined using the def keyword.(define)
# We have two main types of functions i.e:
# 1. In-built functions -> They come preinstalled with thje interpreter i.e print(), pop(), range(), append() etc...
# 2. User defined functions -> They are created by a programmer to solve a given task.
# To define a function you need to give it a name followed by parenthesis.
# For the function body it is usually indented and to invoke a function you use the function name.
